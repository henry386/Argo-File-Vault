# Argo-File-Vault
## Windows Command Line Application for Creating Encrypted, Portable Volumes
### Over-View
This Command Line Application Generates and Reads ".encv" files that act as a volume for the Interpreter and Can be used to store many other files within it.
The Volumes all use the AES Algorithm with a 256 Bit Key, so the data stored within the volume is pretty safe as long as the password is kept secure.
The Volume is also fully portable, meaning that the file generated by the application can be read on any computer using this program.

### How To Use
1. Run the Program on a Windows Computer (Linux / Python Version Coming Soon)
2. Select 1 to load in a file that has already been made and 2 to create a new file
3. Set the Key and you are good to go!

### Commands
As this program runs in the Command Line Interface I have made use of commands to make it easier to interface with the program.
(This can Be accessed by typing "help" once you have created a Volume)

Help Menu:
     dir : List All files within the Volume
     upload : Upload file from Source File System (upload filename)
     export : Export a file from the volume to the Source File System (export filenameonvolume locationonlocaldisk)
     exit : Quit the application");
     peak : Print the Contents of a File to the Terminal Screen (peak filenameonvolume)
     rm : Removes the File from the Volume (rm filenameonvolume)
